This is the first version of _Creatures of Myth_, a two-player board game that I completed in 2022. 

The game is still unfinished in terms of artwork, rulebooks, and balancing. After around 30 hours of playtesting, I decided that the game needed a few major overhauls. I want to eventually make formal artwork and publish the game, but don't want a product I feel is lacking. 

I'm currently a few hundred hours into the updated version of the game. We've done some playtesting, but it is still missing a few things. The main difference of this version is that players perform actions by playing cards from their hand.
