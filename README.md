# Creatures of Myth - README

This is a two player game in which players control up to 3 unique creatures from mythology on the board. During a turn, players use _Points_ with their creatures to move, attack enemies, and use unique abilities.

The game is broken up into many rounds, during which a total of 7 turns are taken. When a creature dies, you may _Summon_ a new creature to the board. Each player may only _Summon_ twice per game. Defeat all enemy creatures or capture all four _Star Tiles_ to win the game.
